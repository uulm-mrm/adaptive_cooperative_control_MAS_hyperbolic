# adaptive_cooperative_control_MAS_hyperbolic

This repository implements methods for the simulation and the design of adaptive control algorithms presented in the papers [1,2] for the output regulation of multi-agent systems, in which every agent has hyperbolic distributed-parameter dynamics.

# Dependencies

The programms were tested and developed using Matlab R2024b.
The following Matlab toolboxes and external libraries are used.

### Matlab toolboxes
